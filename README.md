# TicTacToe with machine-learning
### Made by GustavoMuraoka & Eric Louren√ßo


## üîéAbout the project
### üìë Describing the Project
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to create an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe game that can play optimally against themselves. The objective is to develop a system that not only understands the game mechanics but also learns from interactions to improve its performance over time. By integrating machine learning algorithms, the project will explore various methods of training a Tic-Tac-Toe AI, from traditional algorithms to advanced reinforcement learning techniques.
